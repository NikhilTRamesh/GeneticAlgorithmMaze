# GeneticAlgorithmMaze

Simple pathfinding genetic algorithm that uses random movement vectors and a fitness function to reach a point of convergence for 2d mazes with optional obstacles. First iteration of code is heavily based on CodeBullet's Genetic Algorithm tutorial and second iteration implements the Weak Learner/Strong Learner approach discussed in PhD level paper published  to Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04649. While this program obviously does not implement all features discussed in the proposed algorithm, it does use main concepts present throughout the paper in order to improve the efficiency of a simple pathfinding program. First iteration files are found under the simplealg branch and second iteration files are found under the simplealgweaklearner branch. All files are Java code that utilizes the Processing open source platform for data processing and visualization within the context of the same file.

A short introduction describing Arxiv implementation and the speed/efficiency benefits seen with the second implementation utilizing the Weak Learner/ Strong Learner approach rather than a standard random approach with simulated genetic evolution. Examples are shown with and without obstacles to show differences in code performance.
