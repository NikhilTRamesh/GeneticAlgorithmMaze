# GeneticAlgorithmMaze

Simple pathfinding genetic algorithm that uses random movement vectors and a fitness function to reach a point of convergence for 2d mazes with optional obstacles. First iteration of code is heavily based on CodeBullet's Genetic Algorithm tutorial and second iteration implements the Weak Learner/Strong Learner approach discussed in 

A short introduction describing Arxiv implementation and the speed/efficiency benefits seen with the second implementation utilizing the Weak Learner/ Strong Learner approach rather than a standard random approach with simulated genetic evolution. Examples are shown with and without obstacles to show differences in code performance.
